We've created a database of songs and artists, and you'll make playlists from them in this challenge. In this first step, select the title of all the songs by the artist named 'Queen'.
SELECT title
FROM songs
WHERE artist = 'Queen'

Now you'll make a 'Pop' playlist. In preparation, select the name of all of the artists from the 'Pop' genre.
SELECT name
FROM artists
WHERE genre = 'Pop

To finish creating the 'Pop' playlist, add another query that will select the title of all the songs from the 'Pop' artists.
SELECT title
FROM songs
WHERE artist IN (SELECT name
FROM artists
WHERE genre = 'Pop')
